# AI-Assisted Coding Workshop: Building with AI Coding Agents

<details>
<summary><strong>Original README</strong></summary>

This is a hands-on workshop about **working with AI coding agents**. You'll learn how to plan and specify requirements, provide context, and build software interactively using AI coding tools.

The project we'll build together is a **multi-agent system** that automatically creates flashcards from Wikipedia articles — but the real focus is on **learning to code with AI**.

You'll learn:
- 🎯 **How to plan and specify requirements** for AI-assisted development
- 📝 **How to provide effective context** to AI coding tools
- 💬 **How to communicate with AI agents** to get the code you want
- 🔄 **How to iterate and refine** when AI doesn't get it right the first time
- 🐛 **How to debug** with AI assistance
- 🏗️ **How to build incrementally** — testing each component before moving forward
- 🤖 **Real-world AI coding workflows** used by professionals

**The flashcard generator** is our vehicle for learning these skills. By the end, you'll have:
- ✅ A working multi-agent system
- ✅ Practical experience with AI-assisted development
- ✅ Techniques you can apply to any coding project

**No prior experience with AI coding tools required** — just bring your curiosity!

2. Create a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Run with: `uv run flashcards "your topic"`

## Jeff's building notes

- I followed along with the Vanishing Gradients episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emzmk2YUu6w
- Created `prompts/cursor_prompt.md` from the dictation sequence in the video
  - I asked Claude to clean up the video subtitles and to prepare a prompt for Cursor
  - There is also a gist with Eleanor's dictated instructions, which I did not use
    - https://gist.github.com/intellectronica/015f1f7ef4ec550512389ceb1974b2b1
    - *I would have used this, but I didn't watch far enough ahead in the video to know about it*
- I submitted the text of `cursor_prompt.md` to Cursor
  - The Cursor agent was set to Plan mode and Auto agent
  - Didn't use GPT 5 becuase I'm on the free plan
- After reviewing the plan I hit Build in Cursor
  - This implemented the whole project, not step-by-step as in the video
  - It took about ten minutes to finish
  - At the end, I copied the usage instructions provided by Cursor to this README
- Cursor didn't ask to commit the changes (is it looking at `AGENTS.md`?)
  - After running `git commit` on the command line, I added Cursor as a coauthor as described here:
  - https://forum.cursor.com/t/how-to-nicely-make-cursor-to-be-commit-co-author-on-github/115782
- Iterated with Cursor to fix some bugs with packaging, env variables, parameter and attribute names
- Successfully ran the program and created flashcards: see `output` directory
